# Terra's Rebalances
A set of *very* specific rebalances I made for Lethal Company. This is meant to moreso be the basis of a modpack I plan on making in the future but I may split up some of the rebalances into their own mods in the future. So for now feel free to use this mod for whatever.

*Please restart Lethal Company if you change any of the config settings.*

# List of rebalances
