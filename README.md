# Terra's Rebalances
Personally tuned tweaks and rebalances for Lethal Company. As of right now there is no customization of the mod however feel free to pull from this mod's source. I may in the future split up some of the tweaks and rebalances into their own mods but for now I am uploading the mod for convenience sake.

# Changes
- Shovel is 8 lbs.
- Butlers have 4 HP on both Singleplayer and Multiplayer.
- Mask Hornets travel at their Multiplayer speed on Singleplayer.
- Mask Hornets and Circuit Bees cannot open doors.
- Jesters use their Singleplayer begin cranking timer for Multiplayer.
	- 25-42 seconds, same as pre-v50.
- Popped Jesters now slam open any doors they come across when accelerated.
	- This is purely a cosmetic change, their door opening speed is unaffected.
- Nutcrackers fire slightly faster when at 2-3 HP.
	- At 2-3 HP, their first shot takes 1.3 seconds to fire and their second shot takes 1 second to fire.
- The timers for determining metal objects getting struck by lightning during Stormy weather have been adjusted to make lightning strikes more spaced out.
